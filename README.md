A counter-sniper discord bot.

The current behavior of the bot is:

On startup the bot finds users that are currently in your server and also in a sniping server and outputs a list.  

Then it monitors the sniping servers and anytime someone who is in your server joins one of the sniping servers, it DMs all of your admins and notifies them what user joined which server.

My current list of sniping servers (DM me if you find more!!!):
* -PokeXperience-
* 100IV Club
* Catch 'Em All
* GoMan.io
* GoManager
* GTA, COD and Pokemon Store
* NECROBOT2
* OwnedCore
* PoGoAPI.co
* PokeBot.ninja
* Pokedex100
* PokeGo++ 2.0
* PokeLovers
* Pokesnipers
* Pokopia
* PokeNoobs
